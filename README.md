# mini-search-engine

This project is aimed at developing a simplified information retrieval system, akin to a search engine. The system indexes a set of textual documents, constructs index structures, and utilizes them to retrieve texts that match a user's query. These functionalities are fundamental in search engines like Google.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to implement the following core functionalities:
* Indexing Documents: The system efficiently indexes a collection of textual documents.
* Index Structure Construction: It constructs index structures like inverted indices or other suitable structures to enable fast and accurate searches.
* User Query Processing: The system processes user queries to retrieve specific information within the indexed documents.
* Search and Retrieval: Using the constructed index structures, the system retrieves documents that best match the user's query, presenting them based on relevance.

## Technology used:
This project is developed entirely in Java.
